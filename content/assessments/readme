authenticity
	assign students into groups of 2-3
	use trello// to track progress through assessments/projects


example assessment
	1
		read code
		write SOLO graded description
	2
		be given similar code
		fix a couple bugs
		fill in some empty lines
	3
		be given a well defined (nearly code) problem
		write code for it
	4
		be given a problem in words
		interpret it
		code a solution

incoming assessment
	ask about topics known to be early hurdles
	- basic tracing
	- variable assignment
	- see sorva thesis apendix a, and 
		- notmatch, 3 weeks, robins
	- story-state matching given code
	- appendix a sorva thesis


and criteria for peer-grading of projects

"weekly" assessments: (really by graph node)
	one-on-one (we sit with them):
		developing notional machine, code understanding:
			they come prepared with paragraph explanations of some code we assign
			and talk about some fresh code together
		they plan a small project up to specs and tests then write the code
		sorva short pg 6
			Sajaniemi et al. [2008] elicited the understandings that novice programmers have of program state by having CS1 students draw and write about how they perceived given Java programsâ€™ state at specific stages of execution. 
	automated:
		some help here
		or replace automation with peer grading.  see below
